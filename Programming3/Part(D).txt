Part(D): # Explain the differences in minimum round trip time to each of these servers in parts A, B, and C. 

While testing several IPs through this program, I was able to confirm that the RTT with the server that was close to me was the smallest.

RTT_min:
(1)Localhost: 0.083ms
(2)cs.stonybrook.edu:5.538ms
(3)Canada web server:7.015ms
(4)UK web server:76.616ms
(5)Russia web server:154.624ms
(6)Japan web server:173.544ms

The minimum RTTs above are from the attached screenshot.
